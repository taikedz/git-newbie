---	USAGE

gitn will tell you whether you have been working on master and allow you to move current changes to a different branch

gitn

	gitn on its own will perform `git fetch` and `git status`

gitn FILES ...

	gitn stated without actions will display each specified file in turn, and show changes in `less` using coloured output.

gitn FILES ... -a

	This will cause "git add" to be called on the files

	Will warn of operating on master.

gitn { FILES ... | "." } -m [MESSAGE ...]

	Commit all staged files with MESSAGE.

	If FILES are specified, adds them.

	If "." is specified instead of a list of files, adds all unstaged changes, and commits them with the message.
